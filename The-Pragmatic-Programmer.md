# The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Anniversary Edition) Notes
My thoughts and what I liked about each chapter or topic as I read them.

## Preface
Kaizen - A Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices, personal efficiency, etc.
When asking someone what they do to make their lawn look so nice, they respond with "Every morning wipe the dew off, every other day mow the grass, and once a week roll it, and after 500 years of doing this, you too can have a nice lawn." This relates to our programming skills. If we continue to make small improvements, and continue learning new things and better ways to code, we will notice improvements much faster than a lawn. To have this "kaizen" mentality is important to getting better.

## Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy
Pragmatic Programmer - An attitude, style, or philosphy of how to approach problems and their solutions.
To be a pragmatic programmer, we need to take ownership of our projects. We should take full responsibility of it's problems, and not sit idly by knowing they exist.

### Topic 1. It's Your Life
Lots of people aren't happy in their jobs, location, or life in general. Programming is one of the easiest jobs to be able to make changes, we're paid well, and we work remotely. But programmers usually don't like change.
You have agency. Try to fix your problems but don't try forever. "You can change your organization, or you can change your organization." Investing in yourself off the clock is important. Do you want something from your current job? Have you asked? This career field provides a wide set of opportunities, be proactive and take them.

### Topic 2. The Cat Ate My Source Code
Take responsibility for your code and actions. Pragmatic programmers take charge of their own career, and aren't scared to admit to failure. Things happen. This means being honest and direct. Trusting your team is essential for creativity and collaboration. You have the right to not accept a responsibility due to possible unforseen uncontrolled events. However, if you do accept a responsibility, take ownership of what is going wrong. Provide options, don't make lame excuses. Run through the conversation in your mind before talking to your boss, how does it sound? Explain what can be done to salvage the situation. Don't be afraid to admit you need help. Flush out all lame excuses before saying them aloud. If you don't know, admit it but make sure you follow it up with "but i'll find out."

### Topic 3. Software Entropy
Entropy - Lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.
Debt and rot can spread uncontrollaby. The culture at work on a project can be a source of rot. Hopelessness can be contagious. Negative thoughts spreading through team members can be a viscious spiral. Don't leave broken windows. If you find broken code, fix it. If you can't fix the code, at least board it up. Neglect accelerates rot faster than any other factor. Don't let entropy win. Do no harm. Don't cause collateral damage because there's a crisis of some sort. One broken window is all it takes to begin the decline. A car will sit on the side of the road for weeks, but as soon as one window is broken, the car is stripped and turned upside down within hours. Don't be the first person to create broken windows in a project.
